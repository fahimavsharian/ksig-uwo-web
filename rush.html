            <h2>What is Rush?</h2>
            <p>
                Recruitment for Kappa Sigma is 365 at Western University. However, Rush is a period that runs one to
                two
                weeks in September and then again in January in which fraternities at Western conduct their annual
                or
                semi-annual new member recruitment. Such weeks are filled with social functions with Sorority
                organizations,
                social gathering with brothers, and a Formal invite only event. Kappa Sigma runs a Fall and Winter
                Rush,
                allowing for two cohorts of new potential brothers each year. </p>

            <p>
                Once you've been extended a Bid, you're not in the fraternity yet. What lies ahead is a phase called
                pledging. You can read all about pledging on our Pledging Information page.

                Rush at Western University is a rewarding and exciting experience for both the chapter members and
                the
                potential new members participating in the process. Rush Week is designed so that undergraduate men
                have
                the
                opportunity to discover what Greek Life has to offer. Each year, we are thrilled to meet the men who
                are
                interested in joining our brotherhood and becoming a part of the great Greek community we have here
                at
                Western University, but most importantly, becoming a part of the most preferred Fraternity
                internationally,
                Kappa Sigma! </p>

            <h3>Formal Rush</h3>
            <p>Formal Rush occurs on the final evening of our rush. It differs from the other official Rush events
                in
                that
                it is invite-only and has a formal dress code, in addition to being typically held at various
                locations
                throughout Western. In the past, Kappa Sigma has held Formal Rush at Alumni's private venues, and
                other
                exclusive locations. In order to be extended a Formal Rush invitation, a prospective new member
                (also
                called
                a Rushee) must impress upon a fraternity that he is worthy of the gesture. If you are unsure if you
                have
                been extended a Formal Rush invitation, ask. In all likelihood, however, you will know when you are
                invited.
                Typically, Rushees arrive at the Fraternity house and are provided transportation to and from the
                Formal
                Rush event that they are attending. If you do choose to accept two Formal Rush invitations that are
                on
                the
                same day, transportation will be provided between the two events. Kappa Sigma strongly recommends
                attending
                its Formal Rush after that of another fraternity.</p>

            <h3>Bids Day</h3>
            <p>When the rush process is over, the members of the different fraternity and sorority chapters will
                meet
                and
                decide whether not they want to extend a bid, or invitation, to students who they think will pledge
                their
                organization. Those who successfully receive a bid will know the following day after the Formal Rush
                event,
                as Kappa Sigma's Rush Chair(s) will contact you with further instruction.
                Once a student accepts a bid to a certain organization, the pledging process begins. This can range
                from
                a
                couple of weeks to an entire semester, In our Chapter it is a 7-8 week process. During this time our
                pledges
                get to build strong relationships with the members of our Chapter, as well as those joining with
                them,
                and
                Kappa Sigma's traditions, values, history, etc. At the end of the pledge period, the new members are
                officially initiated into the chapter and enjoys all the benefits of being a Brother of Xi-Nu
                Chapter,
                and a
                Kappa Sigma initiate.</p>
